/** Segments + meter -> bars. The chord sheet's layout unit is the BAR, not the chord.
 *
 * A chord that vamps for eight bars is ONE segment in the database and EIGHT fragments here:
 * the split is derived, never stored. That keeps the analysis truthful about what the engine
 * heard, keeps editing and resizing operating on real chord boundaries, and keeps a vamp from
 * asking the same practice question eight times.
 *
 * Pure and DOM-free on purpose — this is where the chart's geometry is decided, so it is the
 * thing that has to be cheap to test.
